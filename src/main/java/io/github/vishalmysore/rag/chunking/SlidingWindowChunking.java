 * Sliding Window Chunking Strategy
 * 
 * Creates overlapping chunks by sliding a fixed-size window across the text.

 * 
 * Best for: Healthcare records, continuous narratives, patient notes
 * 
 * Parameters:
 * - windowSize: Number of words per chunk
 * - overlap: Number of words to overlap between consecutive chunks
